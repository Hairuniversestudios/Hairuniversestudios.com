> I'm Christian Anderson also known as Prince Keys. I am an unlicensed at home hair & braid artist. At the age 18 I'm still practicing my crafts and trying to create my hair portfolio. Right now, legally I am not allowed to charge money which is why each hairstyle is for donations with a minimum amount to help me pay for a photography class and attend beauty school to be certified. I am freshly out of high school trying to gain my experience and make money independently. I do my research and I care about the integrity of each hair model. Please read my policy if you are interested in being one of my hair models.Â

> I started being intrigued by hair when I was about four years old. My sister brought home a hair magazine titled "Hair World". and I was obsessed with the magazine and later on started my own hair magazine collection, which I still have til this day. As I got older, I wanted to get dolls with hair that I could braid, and I was too afraid to ask my parents so some of the students at school use to give me their old dolls and barrettes to practice with. My parents saw potential in me being a male hairstylist and started supporting me. Bought me a brand-new doll of my own to style. When I reached high school, I wanted to take hair more seriously, so I bought a hair mannequin and began working on my technique. I graduated High School; I want to get better at styling human's hair and benefit for myself and help others unlock their beauty which is why my nickname is "Prince Keys".

<If you haven't noticed by now my theme is late 90's/2000's inspired. I want to specialize in freaknik ponytails, updos, and my innovative braids and bead designs. I want to be a diverse stylist that doesn't discriminate and knows all textures of hair. I want to do males, females, and children hair & braids. For the photoshoots I am the photographer and I want to make my hair portfolio look as if it came straight out of a 90's hair magazine.>
