> Washing or blow drying is an optional service, however at the proper request for the client I will. Please keep in mind that I am not yet a licensed professional. Yet I shall attempt to provide the best care and treatment for clients. If clients agree to washing and blow drying, there will be no fees-cost. $0.00 USD.Given the matter that I am not legally allowed to charge, all provided services are here-by considered donation,however with minimum price. My skills are of not the best, which is why I ask of clients to gain additional patiences with me as I gain more experience with and practice. It approximately takes me 9-10 hours for each hairstyle so please be mindful of your schedule before booking with me. I am still learning. I can’t handle more than 1 guest unless they are children under 12. Please know I am not a babysitter I am a stylist. No vaping, smoking, or drinking. I am a child friendly service

> For my hair models:

I supply the hair & accessories, but I do not supply makeup or clothes. You are required to wear a color scheme for the photoshoot. You are allowed to pick one of the hairstyle options for the model services only. Once you have picked your desired style to model contact me and I will let you know what colors to wear. We prefer you to also wear makeup due to the lighting set up. If you cannot reach a makeup artist do not worry, we don’t need it to be 100% perfect we just need something on your face to match the scheme even if you have to do it yourself nothing too big. If you are allergic to anything, please let me know so I know what products not to use and you are also welcome to bring your own products if you don't feel comfortable with the products I use. Blow Drying is not mandatory, there are alternatives to stretch your hair if you are not a fan of heat.
